# Coffee-Chat

Welcome to the CoffeeChat Project!

This is just a small, lightweight chat server and client. So far it only contains a few basic features, but my goal is to make it a lot better. Feel free to contribute by adding your own bits of code, and opening a pull request!

If you're a developer and would like to contribute your time to developing this application or extending the wiki, please let me know on by email: sidharth.kogarah@gmail.com (This is just to add you to the organisation).

You can download the main folder and import it straight into Eclipse IDE, or, if you're using IntelliJ or NetBeans, you can go straight to Coffee-Chat/CoffeeChat/src and download the .java files from there.

If you have any problems with the code or the finished app (in Coffee-Chat), please let me know on the Issues page.
